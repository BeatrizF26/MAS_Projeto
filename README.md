# MAS Project

This project involves developing a platform designed to understand users' needs and intentions through use cases and requirements gathered from analyses done in previous lessons and works.

In this case, our project is a website that allows users to order cakes from bakeries making the process more efficient when compared to in-person orders. Additionally, the platform enables users to customize their cake, providing a more personalized experience.
